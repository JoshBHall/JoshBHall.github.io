My personal portfolio page

### Home
The Home section of my porfolio page is all about welcoming the visitor to my page and starting to tell them a little about me.  It includes a pleasant visual background.  This will continue to be updated and refreshed throughout the life of the website.

### Slideshow
The Slideshow section shows some pictures, in slideshow fashion, which tell a little more about me and my knowledge, culminating in a slide that opens the contact form.

### About
The About section has a picture of me, as well as a brief description of who I am, where I learned, and what I know.  It also says that I'm looking for work and links to the contact form.

### Github
The Github section includes links to my personal github page.

### Contact
The contact form includes an input form that pops out and asks for name, phone number, email, and a message from guests to my site.  It routes this information to my personal email so that I might return contact with anyone interested in reaching out.
